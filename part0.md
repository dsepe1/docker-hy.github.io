## General ##

This course is an introductory course to Docker and docker-compose. The course will also look into what different parts web services consist of, such as reverse proxies, databases, etc. Docker cannot be installed on faculty computers, so students will need to provide their own computers to follow the examples outlined in this course material and to complete the exercises.

### Prerequisites ###

Attendees need to provide their own computers with admin/superuser priviledges. Attendees are also expected to have a general understanding of software development and experience with a CLI of their choice.

### Course material ###

The course material is meant to be read sequentially, part by part, from start to finish. To get a passing grade you have to complete each exercise, although one exercise can be skipped for each part. Some of the exercises are marked as mandatory and those can not be skipped. The exercises are placed in the material in such a way that you will have learned the necessary skills from the material prior to each given exercise. You can do the exercises as you're going through the material.

The course material is written for Ubuntu, so some instructions may lack platform specific details. Please make a [pull request](https://docker-hy.github.io/contributing) to the course material in case you find any mistakes or wish to add something. You can also [contribute](https://docker-hy.github.io/contributing) through github in case you find any issues with the course material.

### Completing course ###

The course is composed of 4 parts, first of which is part 0 and contains the pre-requisites for all the upcoming exercises. The parts should take 5-25 hours each to complete.

Remember to enrol for the course through courses page: <https://courses.helsinki.fi/en/aytkt21025en/129059389>. After filling the form, **it will take 1 day for your registration to activate**, after which you'll get access to the last exercise through Moodle. This is required to get the credits.

### Grading ##

Passing this course requires you to do the exercises for each part. This means every exercise, except one for each part. Some of the exercises are mandatory and can not be skipped. This course is worth 1-3 credits depending on the completed parts.
Completing part 1 gives you 1 credit. Completing parts 1 and 2 is worth 2 credits. Completing all of the parts will grant you 3 credits.

### Learning objectives ###

Part 1

Can explain what images and containers are and how they're related.
Can build images with Docker for existing projects and run them.

Part 2

Can manage complex multi-container applications with docker-compose.

Part 3

Can optimize images sizes and security for production.
Knows why docker-compose is not an optimal production solution and what is.

## Installing Docker ##

Use the official documentation to find download instructions for docker-ce for the platform of your choice:

[Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

[MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

[Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

Confirm that Docker installed correctly by opening a terminal and running `docker -v` to see the installed version.

> TIP: Windows 10 Home does not support Hyper-V. I recommend installing another OS such as Ubuntu. Remember to back up everything. Instructions for dual boot [here](https://hackernoon.com/installing-ubuntu-18-04-along-with-windows-10-dual-boot-installation-for-deep-learning-f4cd91b58557)

## Installing docker-compose ##

During the writing of these materials, both MacOS and Windows have docker-compose included in their respective Docker packages.

Use the official documentation to find download instructions for docker-compose for the platform of your choice:

[Install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Confirm that docker-compose installed correctly by opening a terminal and running `docker-compose -v` to see the installed docker-compose version.

> TIP: To avoid writing sudos you may consider [adding yourself to docker group](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)
